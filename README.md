# Photon
Photon Project  |  The Creative Javascript Course

This project was developed using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, to study how to fetch APIs. In this particular case, we used Pexels API to search for pictures.

We went through some topics, such as:

* selectors;
* events;
* functions;
* fetchApi;
